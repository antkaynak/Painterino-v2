    "PORT": 3000,
    "MONGODB_URI": "mongodb://yourdatabaseurl",
    "JWT_SECRET": "yourjwtsecret"

### Database 
This application uses NoSQL database MongoDB and a Schema library mongoose.
Mongoose script is below.

```
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;
const userSchema = new Schema({
    email: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        minlength: 1,
        trim: true,
        unique: true,
        validate: {
            validator: (value) => {
                const re = /^[a-zA-Z0-9_!#$%&â€™*+/=?`{|}~^.-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+$/;
                return (value == null || value.trim().length < 1) || re.test(value);
            },
            message: '{VALUE} is not a valid email'
        }
    },
    username: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        minlength: 1,
        trim: true,
        unique: true
    },
    password: {

        required: true,
        minlength: 6,
    },
    tokens: [{
        access: {
            type: String,
            required: true
        },
        token: {
            type: String,
            required: true
        }
    }]
